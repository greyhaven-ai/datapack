This module provides carefully engineered system prompts for different
document processing tasks to ensure high-quality extraction results.
"""

# Metadata extraction prompts
TITLE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at extracting document titles. Your task is to identify the most 
appropriate title for the given document. The title should be:

For each entity, provide the entity name and its type. Respond with a list in the format:
"Entity Name (Type)", with each entity on a new line.
"""

KEY_POINTS_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at identifying the key points in a document. Your task is to extract
3-5 main points or takeaways from the given document. Each key point should:
1. Represent an important idea, finding, or conclusion
2. Be expressed as a complete sentence
3. Be specific enough to convey meaningful information
4. Be concise (1-2 sentences each)

Respond with a numbered list of key points, with each point on a new line.
"""

# Structure extraction prompts
STRUCTURE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert document structure analyzer. Your task is to extract the hierarchical
structure of the given document. Identify:
1. All headings and their levels (H1, H2, etc.)
2. The content under each heading
3. Any references cited in the document
4. Tables, images, and code blocks present in the document

Organize this information hierarchically, maintaining the structure of the original document.
"""

SECTION_IDENTIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at identifying document sections. Your task is to break down the given
document into its logical sections. For each section, provide:
1. The section heading (if present)
2. The section's hierarchical level (1 for top-level, 2 for subsections, etc.)
3. A brief description of what the section contains (1 sentence)

If the document doesn't have explicit headings, identify implicit section breaks based on
content shifts or topic changes.
"""

# Relationship extraction prompts
RELATIONSHIP_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at identifying relationships between documents. For the given document
and list of potential related documents, determine:
1. Which documents are referenced or mentioned
2. The nature of the relationship (parent, child, related, reference)
3. The context in which the reference occurs
4. Your confidence in this relationship (0.0-1.0)

Only identify clear references, not speculative connections. For each relationship,
provide the title of the referenced document, the relationship type, and the context.
"""

# Content enhancement prompts
SUMMARY_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert document summarizer. Create a comprehensive summary of the provided
document that captures its main points, purpose, and conclusions. The summary should be:
{length_guidance}

Focus on the most important information, maintain the original meaning, and present
the information in a clear, logical order. Use an objective tone.
"""

ANNOTATION_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert document annotator. Generate {type_instruction} for the provided document.
For each annotation, include:
1. The annotation text
2. The relevant context from the document
3. If possible, an approximate position (paragraph or section number)

Your annotations should add value by highlighting important points, raising questions,
or providing additional context not explicitly stated in the document.
"""

IMPROVEMENT_SUGGESTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert document editor. Analyze the provided document and suggest 
{type_instruction}. For each suggestion, include:
1. The specific improvement suggestion
2. The rationale for this improvement

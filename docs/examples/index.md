- [Simple Document](basic/simple-document.md) - Create, read, and work with a basic document
- [Document Parsing](basic/document-parsing.md) - Parse different document formats into Datapack

## MDP Examples

These examples cover working with the Markdown Data Pack (MDP) format:

- [User-Friendly MDP API](mdp/user_friendly_api.md) - Using the enhanced Document and Collection API
- [Basic MDP Usage](basic/mdp/usage_example.py) - Working with the core MDP file format

## Metadata Examples

These examples focus on working with document metadata:

- [Standard Metadata](metadata/standard-metadata.md) - Working with standard metadata fields
- [Custom Metadata](metadata/custom-metadata.md) - Creating and using custom metadata schemas

## Context & Annotation Examples

These examples show how to add context and annotations to documents:

- [Adding Context](context/adding-context.md) - Adding contextual information to documents
- [Context Processing](context/context-processing.md) - Processing documents with contextual awareness

## Relationship Examples

These examples demonstrate document relationships:

- [Document Relationships](relationships/document-relationships.md) - Creating and working with document relationships
- [Cross-referencing](relationships/cross-referencing.md) - Implementing cross-references between documents

## Advanced Examples

# Project Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the project's architecture, explaining the main components
and how they interact with each other.

## Core Components

### Data Layer

The data layer is responsible for:
- Data storage and retrieval
- Data validation
- Data transformation

### Business Logic Layer

The business logic layer contains:
- Core domain models
- Business rules and validation
- Service orchestration

### Presentation Layer

The presentation layer handles:
- User interface components
- API endpoints
- Response formatting

## Component Interactions

Components interact through well-defined interfaces, following these principles:
1. Lower layers should not depend on higher layers
2. Communication between components should be explicit
3. Each component should have a single responsibility

## Design Decisions

Key architectural decisions include:
- Using a modular approach to enable independent development
- Implementing clear interfaces between components
- Prioritizing testability in the design
- Maintaining backward compatibility for public APIs
